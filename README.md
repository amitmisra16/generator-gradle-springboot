## Why another gradle and springboot based generator?

Gradle has great scafolding capabilities for quickly bringing up a multi-module setup. 
There are few gaps here:

* `app` is not a spring-boot based application.
* Adding more than two `library` or `api` project.
* The names of the `library`, `api` and `app` projects/modules are not configurable

The [SpringInitializr](https://start.spring.io) helps in generating springboot based application with all the dependencies you need. In a way addresses the first issues but then how would add this generated app to existing build chain.

## Gradle-Springboot generator

This plugin bridges the gap by enabling you to leverage multi-module setup capability of gralde with springboot based applications. You can declare the names of your library/api and application projects and the generator will scafold the code generated by gradle. In case of an application it adds basic `@SpringbootApplication` annotation to the main class.

This plugin also utilizes Gradle's `buildSrc` conventions and appropriately scafolds library and application project's `build.gradle` files.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-gradle-springboot using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```

Then generate your new project:
